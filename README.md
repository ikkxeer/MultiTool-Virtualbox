# MultiTool-Virtualbox

# Description :tea:
Welcome to a great project and personal challenge how to develop, this project is about a program to facilitate automation in virtualbox and make a support program.
This program is not officially part of VirtualBox, it is just an extension programmed in Python for tasks that you would normally spend a lot of time doing by hand. We want to speed up work for students, workers and freelancers who work with virtualbox and must do very repetitive tasks.

## Program objectives :zap:
Mainly, the development of this program is aimed at learning and training as a programmer. In addition to this, I want people to be able to make great and good use of my program and that it can be useful in saving time and making it easier for them tasks

## Goals :wrench:
- [x] Add a new user interface :tada:
- [x] Mass creation of disks on machine :relaxed:
- [ ] Cleaning virtual machine disks
- [ ] Massive silent installation
- [ ] Auto driver detection in virtual machine

## Community :chart_with_upwards_trend:
The functionalities that I have in mind will be added, but any type of suggestion from the community and contribution to the project will be accepted, anyone who is a fan of programming and wants to contribute to the project will be valued.
The project is free to use and I would love for other developers to be able to create their own improved versions of it and modify it freely!
